Integrating a robust **API payment gateway** at its core, this project transforms the ordering experience at Amber Coffee by enabling secure, instant cashless transactions. Developed in August 2025, the system was built to handle high-volume orders during peak campus hours, effectively reducing queue times.

The platform utilizes **Vue.js** to deliver a fast, app-like experience on mobile browsers, allowing customers to customize orders and pay without leaving their tables.
